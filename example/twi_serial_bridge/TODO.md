twi\_serial\_bridge TODO
========================

* change it so that 1-byte address reads and writes work on standard TWI devices, and 2-byte address reads and writes work on ../../TWISlaveMem14.c TWI devices
* make non-verbose mode spit out even less
* document TWI register debug via SPI and probably start with it turned off
* stop relying on Arduino libraries
